Great! It looks like you've developed a face recognition attendance system that captures and stores face data for later recognition using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Below is a suggested description and usage guide for your GitHub repository that reflects the features and functionality of your project.

## Repository Description

### Attendance System with Face Recognition

This project implements an attendance system that captures and recognizes faces in real-time. It utilizes OpenCV for video capture and face detection, along with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for face recognition. The system allows users to input their names, captures their facial data, and saves it for future attendance tracking.

### Features

- Real-time video capture from a webcam.
- Face detection using Haar cascades.
- Capture and store facial images for up to 100 samples per individual.
- Save captured faces and corresponding names in pickle files for easy retrieval.
- Simple user interface to input names and visualize the captured frames.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pickle

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-system.git
   cd attendance-system
   ```

2. **Prepare the Data Directory:**

   Create a directory named `data` in the root of your project. Inside this directory, ensure you have the Haar cascade file for face detection. You can download it from [OpenCV's GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).

3. **Run the Application:**

   Start the application by running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Input Your Name:**

   When prompted, enter your name. The application will start capturing frames from your webcam.

5. **Capture Faces:**

   The application will detect faces in real-time. It will capture up to 100 samples of your face, which will be used for recognition later. Press 'q' to stop capturing when you have enough samples.

6. **Check Saved Data:**

   The captured facial data and names will be saved in `data/faces_data.pkl` and `data/names.pkl`, respectively.

## Usage

- Launch the application and enter your name when prompted.
- The application will display a window showing the video feed with detected faces.
- The number of captured face samples will be displayed on the screen.
- Once you reach 100 samples or press 'q', the application will stop capturing.
